# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way to track changes that have been made to files so that you can backtrack if your code become problematic.   It is helpful in keeping the integrity of the code.  Also, often times, several people will be working on a code.  Version Control is a way of managing everyone's work, and ensuring tha the code remains stable; even with a bunch of coders working together.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the master code for you to work on.  This ensures that the master code remains clean, while you work on the code. 


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Once you have completed the code in your checked-out branch and you are ready to have it merged with the master branch, you commit the file.  This serves as a save-point, so that the checked out branch can be merged with the master branch.  A good commit message is one that is detailed as to the changes made to the code that was checked out.


* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when the branches that are being merge into the master branch have codes that are in conflict with each other; as in git doesn't know which version it should merge into the master branch.
